# PRD: Discord Command Executor

## Executive Summary

The Discord Command Executor is a standalone Discord bot built in Go that transforms Discord channels into secure remote terminal interfaces. It enables authorized users to execute system commands directly from Discord with real-time output streaming, command aliasing, and comprehensive security controls. This solution eliminates the need for SSH access while maintaining enterprise-grade security through role-based permissions and command filtering.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Server administrators and developers currently need SSH access or physical server access to perform routine maintenance tasks, troubleshooting, and system operations. This creates friction, especially for:
- Quick server maintenance (restarting services, checking system status)
- Collaborative debugging sessions where multiple team members need command visibility
- Emergency situations where SSH access may be unavailable or slow
- Routine monitoring tasks that require periodic command execution

**Why is this important now?**
- Remote work has increased the need for accessible server management tools
- Discord has become a primary communication platform for technical teams
- SSH key management and VPN requirements create barriers to quick server operations
- Real-time command output sharing improves team collaboration and troubleshooting

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**1. System Administrator (Power User)**
- Needs full system access for maintenance and troubleshooting
- Requires ability to execute any command including sudo operations
- Values real-time feedback and command history

**2. Developer (Limited User)**
- Needs specific command access for deployment and debugging
- Requires ability to restart services, check logs, run tests
- Should not have access to system-critical operations

**3. Monitor/Observer (Read-Only User)**
- Needs ability to check system status and run diagnostic commands
- Should not be able to modify system state
- Requires access to monitoring and reporting commands only

### Detailed User Journeys

**Journey 1: Emergency Service Restart**
1. Admin receives alert about service failure in Discord
2. Admin types `!restart nginx` in designated channel
3. Bot authenticates user permissions and executes command
4. Real-time output shows service stopping and starting
5. Bot confirms successful restart with exit code
6. Team sees the resolution without needing separate communication

**Journey 2: Real-time Log Monitoring**
1. Developer runs `!tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log` for live monitoring
2. Bot starts streaming output in Discord, updating message in real-time
3. As new logs exceed Discord message limits, older content is truncated
4. Bot maintains only the latest output visible within Discord limits
5. When monitoring stops, complete logs are uploaded to pastebin with shareable link

**Journey 3: Large Output Command**
1. Admin runs `!find /var -name "*.log" -size +100M` to find large files
2. Output exceeds Discord message size limits
3. Bot shows initial output preview in Discord
4. Complete results automatically uploaded to pastebin
5. Bot provides pastebin link for full output access

**Journey 4: Collaborative Debugging**
1. Developer encounters production issue
2. Developer runs `!logs webapp tail -f` to stream logs
3. Multiple team members see live log output in Discord
4. Senior developer suggests running `!ps aux | grep webapp`
5. Team collaboratively debugs using shared command output
6. Issue resolved through team coordination via Discord

### Pain Points Being Addressed

- **Completion Handling**: Final message shows exit code and execution time

### Large Output Handling
- **Size Threshold**: Automatically upload outputs >1500 characters to pastebin
- **Preview Strategy**: Show first 1000 characters in Discord + pastebin link
- **Service Selection**: Configurable pastebin service (pastebin.com, hastebin, etc.)
- **Link Management**: Track and optionally expire pastebin links
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when pastebin services unavailable

### Configuration Options
```yaml
output:
  discord_limit: 1900          # Leave room for formatting
  pastebin_threshold: 1500     # Upload threshold
  rolling_buffer_lines: 50     # Max lines in real-time display
  update_interval: 500         # Milliseconds between updates
  pastebin_service: "hastebin" # Default service
  link_expiry: "24h"          # Auto-expire links
```

## Security Recommendations

Based on the requirements for tight security mechanisms:

### Command Execution Security
- **Sandboxing**: Use containerized execution or chroot jails for command isolation
- **Resource Limits**: Implement CPU, memory, and execution time limits
- **Network Restrictions**: Limit network access for executed commands
- **File System Protection**: Restrict file system access to designated directories

### Access Control
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Require additional verification for high-privilege commands
- **Time-based Access**: Implement temporary access grants with automatic expiration
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict bot access to known Discord server IPs
- **Command Approval**: Require peer approval for destructive operations

### External Service Security
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of pastebin service keys
- **Content Filtering**: Sanitize sensitive information before external upload
- **Access Controls**: Use private/unlisted pastes when possible
- **Audit Trail**: Log all external uploads with metadata

### Default Security Policies
**Blacklisted Commands (Default)**:
```
rm -rf, dd, mkfs, fdisk, format, shutdown -h, halt, 
init 0, reboot -f, killall -9, chmod 777, chown root,
passwd, sudo su -, su -, usermod, deluser, userdel
```

**Recommended Whitelist for Non-Admin Roles**:
```
ls, ps, top, df, free, uptime, whoami, pwd, cat (limited paths),
docker ps, docker logs, systemctl status, journalctl -f,
ping, curl (limited hosts), git status, git log, mtr
```
