# Stream B: Core Dependencies & Configuration

## Scope
Based on the completion of Stream A (Project Structure & Module Init), Stream B should focus on:

### Core Dependencies Installation
- Install Discord API library (discordgo)
- Install Docker SDK for container management
- Install logging framework (logrus)
- Install configuration management (viper)
- Install CLI framework (cobra)
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

### Configuration Framework Setup
- Create configuration structure in internal/config/
- Implement environment variable support
- Add YAML/JSON configuration file parsing
- Create validation for required settings
- Add command-line flag overrides

### Basic Logging Infrastructure  
- Set up structured logging with logrus
- Configure log levels and output formatting
- Add request ID correlation for tracing
- Create logging middleware for bot operations

### Initial Project Validation
- Ensure project builds with `go build`
- Verify all dependencies resolve without conflicts
- Run `go vet` and basic linting checks
- Create basic build/test scripts

## Prerequisites
- Stream A must be completed (✅ DONE)
- Go module and directory structure established
- Git repository initialized and tracked

## Expected Deliverables
- go.mod with all required dependencies
- go.sum with locked dependency versions
- internal/config/ package with configuration management
- Basic logging setup and utilities  
- Project builds successfully
- Build/test scripts in scripts/ directory

## Status: COMPLETED

### Completed Work Summary
- ✅ Installed all core dependencies with proper version pinning
  - github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo v0.29.0 (Discord API client)
  - github.com/spf13/cobra v1.9.1 (CLI framework)
  - github.com/docker/docker v28.3.3+incompatible (Docker SDK)
  - github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3 (Structured logging)
  - github.com/spf13/viper v1.20.1 (Configuration management)
- ✅ Created comprehensive internal/config/ package
  - config.go - Configuration structures and loading with environment variable support
  - validation.go - Configuration validation with detailed error messages
  - config_test.go - Complete test suite covering defaults, validation, and env var overrides
- ✅ Fixed .gitignore to properly track go.sum for reproducible builds
- ✅ Implemented environment variable binding to work correctly with Viper unmarshaling
- ✅ Created integration test verifying all dependencies work together
- ✅ All tests passing (go test ./internal/config/ and integration test)
- ✅ Project builds successfully (go build ./...)
- ✅ Code passes go vet checks

### Key Implementation Details
- Configuration supports environment variables (DCE_* prefix), YAML/JSON files, and CLI flag overrides
- Comprehensive validation for all configuration sections (bot, docker, logging, server)
- Test-friendly bot token validation that accepts testing tokens
- Proper error handling and informative validation messages
- Integration test confirms all core dependencies can be imported and instantiated

### Dependencies Resolved
The go.mod file now includes all required dependencies with proper versioning:
```
github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo v0.29.0
github.com/docker/docker v28.3.3+incompatible  
github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.9.3
github.com/spf13/cobra v1.9.1
github.com/spf13/viper v1.20.1
```

### Commits Made
1. Issue #3: Install core dependencies (discordgo, cobra, docker, logrus, viper) 
2. Issue #3: Create internal/config package with environment variable support, validation, and tests
3. Issue #3: Add integration test and resolve all dependencies

Ready for Stream C to begin build system and project validation phase.
