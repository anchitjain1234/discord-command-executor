# Stream B: Core Dependencies & Configuration

## Scope
Based on the completion of Stream A (Project Structure & Module Init), Stream B should focus on:

### Core Dependencies Installation
- Install Discord API library (discordgo)
- Install Docker SDK for container management
- Install logging framework (logrus)
- Install configuration management (viper)
- Install CLI framework (cobra)
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds

### Configuration Framework Setup
- Create configuration structure in internal/config/
- Implement environment variable support
- Add YAML/JSON configuration file parsing
- Create validation for required settings
- Add command-line flag overrides

### Basic Logging Infrastructure  
- Set up structured logging with logrus
- Configure log levels and output formatting
- Add request ID correlation for tracing
- Create logging middleware for bot operations

### Initial Project Validation
- Ensure project builds with `go build`
- Verify all dependencies resolve without conflicts
- Run `go vet` and basic linting checks
- Create basic build/test scripts

## Prerequisites
- Stream A must be completed (âœ… DONE)
- Go module and directory structure established
- Git repository initialized and tracked

## Expected Deliverables
- go.mod with all required dependencies
- go.sum with locked dependency versions
- internal/config/ package with configuration management
- Basic logging setup and utilities  
- Project builds successfully
- Build/test scripts in scripts/ directory

## Status: PENDING
Ready to begin once assigned to a developer or continuation stream.
