# Stream C: Build System & Project Validation

## Scope
Building upon the completed dependency management (Stream B), Stream C focuses on:

### Build System Setup
- Create build/test scripts in scripts/ directory
- Set up linting and code quality checks
- Implement go vet and go fmt validation
- Create Makefile for common development tasks
- Set up continuous integration preparation scripts

### Project Validation Framework
- Ensure all `go build` operations succeed
- Verify `go vet` passes with no warnings
- Run comprehensive test suite across all packages
- Validate integration between all installed dependencies
- Create project health check scripts

### Development Workflow Tools
- Create development environment setup scripts
- Add formatting and linting automation
- Implement pre-commit hook suggestions
- Document build and test procedures
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

### Final Integration Testing
- End-to-end build process validation
- Cross-platform build testing (if applicable)
- Performance baseline establishment
- Memory usage profiling for dependency load
- Final acceptance criteria verification

## Prerequisites
- Stream B must be completed (âœ… DONE)
- All core dependencies installed and tested
- Configuration package functional with comprehensive test coverage
- Project builds successfully and passes basic integration tests

## Expected Deliverables
- scripts/ directory with build, test, lint, and development scripts
- Makefile with standard targets (build, test, lint, clean, install)
- CI/CD preparation scripts and configuration templates
- Documentation for build processes and development workflow
- Project passes all quality gates (build, test, vet, lint)
- Performance and resource usage benchmarks established

## Success Criteria
- `make build` produces working executable
- `make test` runs all tests with 100% pass rate
- `make lint` passes with no violations
- `go vet ./...` produces no warnings
- Integration tests demonstrate all dependencies work together
- Project ready for next development phase (bot implementation)

## Status: PENDING
Ready to begin build system and validation setup. Stream B dependency management is complete and all prerequisites are satisfied.
