# Task: Core Command Execution Engine

## Description

Implement the secure command execution engine that processes Discord commands and executes them in isolated containers. This includes container lifecycle management, security sandboxing, output capture, and result formatting for Discord responses.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Container-based command execution implemented
- [ ] Security sandbox with resource limits enforced
- [ ] Command timeout and resource monitoring
- [ ] Output capture and formatting for Discord
- [ ] Error handling for execution failures
- [ ] Command history and audit logging
- [ ] Concurrent execution management with limits
- [ ] Clean container lifecycle (create, execute, cleanup)
- [ ] Support for different execution environments (shell, python, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Execution Engine Architecture
```go
// internal/executor/engine.go
type Engine struct {
    client      docker.Client
    config      *ExecutionConfig
    logger      *logrus.Logger
    limiter     *rate.Limiter
    activeJobs  sync.Map
}

type ExecutionResult struct {
    ExitCode    int
    Stdout      string
    Stderr      string
    Duration    time.Duration
    ResourceUsage ResourceStats
    Error       error
}
```

### Container Management
- Docker container creation with security constraints
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Execution timeouts (configurable per command type)
- Container cleanup and garbage collection
- Image management and security scanning

### Security Framework
- User namespace isolation
- Filesystem restrictions (read-only, tmpfs)
- Network isolation (no external access by default)
- Capability dropping (minimal privileges)
- Resource quotas enforcement
- Command whitelist/blacklist validation

### Output Processing
- Stream capture from container stdout/stderr
- Unicode and binary data handling
- Output size limits for Discord message constraints
- Formatting for code blocks and syntax highlighting
- Error message sanitization

### Concurrency Management
- Maximum concurrent executions limit
- Per-user execution rate limiting
- Queue management for overflow requests
- Graceful degradation under load

## Dependencies

- Task 001: Go Project Setup and Dependencies
- Task 002: Basic Discord Bot Framework

## Effort Estimate

3 days

## Definition of Done

- Commands execute successfully in isolated containers
- Security sandbox prevents privilege escalation
- Resource limits prevent system overload
- Output formatting works correctly in Discord
- Concurrent execution limits are enforced
- Container cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Audit logging captures all execution attempts
- Performance tests validate execution speed
- Security tests verify isolation effectiveness
- Code coverage > 85% for execution engine components
