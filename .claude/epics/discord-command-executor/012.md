### Documentation Suite
- [ ] User manual with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Administrator guide for deployment and maintenance
- [ ] API documentation for extensibility
- [ ] Security guide and best practices
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide and FAQ
- [ ] Change log and version management

### Monitoring and Operations
- [ ] Application performance monitoring (APM)
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis setup
- [ ] Error tracking and notification system
- [ ] Capacity planning and scaling procedures
- [ ] Incident response and escalation procedures

### Production Validation
- [ ] Production environment smoke tests
- [ ] Performance validation under load
- [ ] Security validation in production environment
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing in production

### Monitoring Stack
- **Application Monitoring**: Health endpoints, performance metrics, error tracking
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: System resources, network connectivity, service status
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging, log analysis, audit trail monitoring
- **Alerting**: Real-time notifications, escalation procedures, on-call management

### Production Configuration
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Secure credential management (secrets, API keys)
- Performance tuning parameters
- Security hardening settings
- Monitoring and logging configuration

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Build Phase**: Compile binaries, run tests, security scanning
2. **Package Phase**: Create container images, configuration packages
3. **Deploy Phase**: Rolling deployment with health checks
4. **Validate Phase**: Smoke tests, performance validation
5. **Monitor Phase**: Post-deployment monitoring and alerting
