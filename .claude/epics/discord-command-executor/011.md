# Task: Security Audit and Logging

## Description

Implement comprehensive security auditing, threat assessment, and logging infrastructure for the Discord command executor. This includes security hardening, vulnerability assessment, audit trail implementation, and monitoring systems to ensure the application meets enterprise security standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Process isolation using Linux namespaces and cgroups
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] Command blacklist/whitelist enforcement
- [ ] Resource limits and rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Secure credential storage and encryption
- [ ] Network security controls and access restrictions

### Vulnerability Assessment
- [ ] Automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) integration
- [ ] Penetration testing for common attack vectors
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Security code review checklist implementation
- [ ] Threat modeling documentation
- [ ] Security incident response procedures

### Audit Logging
- [ ] Comprehensive audit trail for all command executions
- [ ] Security event logging (authentication, authorization, failures)
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Log integrity protection and tamper detection
- [ ] Log retention and rotation policies
- [ ] Real-time security monitoring and alerting

### Compliance and Documentation
- [ ] Security configuration documentation
- [ ] Incident response playbook
- [ ] Security testing procedures
- [ ] Compliance checklist for deployment
- [ ] Security training materials
- [ ] Regular security review schedule

```

### Audit Trail Implementation
- **Command Execution Events**: User, command, timestamp, success/failure, output size
- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, token validation, session management
- **Authorization Events**: Permission checks, role changes, access denials
- **System Events**: Configuration changes, service starts/stops, errors
- **Security Events**: Failed authentication, suspicious activity, policy violations

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time detection of suspicious command patterns
- Rate limiting violations and potential abuse
- Failed authentication attempts and brute force detection
- Privilege escalation attempts and unauthorized access
- Anomalous resource usage patterns

### Threat Modeling
- **Assets**: Discord bot token, system access, audit logs, configuration data
- **Threats**: Command injection, privilege escalation, data exfiltration, DoS attacks
- **Vulnerabilities**: Input validation flaws, permission bypasses, process escapes
- **Controls**: Input sanitization, sandboxing, audit logging, access controls

### Security Scanning Integration
- **Static Analysis**: gosec for Go security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: nancy for known vulnerabilities
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Integration testing with security scenarios
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning for deployment containers
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Host system security assessment

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- All core features implemented (tasks 001-009)
- Logging infrastructure in place
- Configuration management system
- Authentication and authorization systems

### External Dependencies
- Security scanning tools (gosec, nancy, bandit)
- Log management system (ELK stack, Splunk, or similar)
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Certificate management for encryption
- Network security tools and firewalls

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- Centralized logging infrastructure
- Security monitoring platform
- Incident response tools
- Backup and recovery systems
- Network security controls
