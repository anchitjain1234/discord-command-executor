# Epic: Discord Command Executor

## Overview

A secure Discord bot implemented in Go that enables remote command execution on host servers through Discord channels. The system provides role-based access control, real-time output streaming with intelligent truncation, external pastebin integration for large outputs, and comprehensive security controls including command filtering and audit logging.

## Architecture Decisions

**Core Technology Stack:**
- **Language**: Go - chosen for performance, concurrency support, and system-level operations
- **Discord Library**: discordgo - mature, well-maintained Go library for Discord API
- **Process Execution**: os/exec package with custom wrappers for security and monitoring
- **Configuration**: YAML-based config files with encrypted sensitive data storage
- **Logging**: structured logging with logrus for audit trails and debugging

**Key Design Patterns:**
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulate command execution with validation, permissions, and audit logging
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable pastebin services and permission providers
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time output streaming to Discord with multiple subscribers
- **Circuit Breaker**: Resilient external service integration (pastebin, Discord API)

**Security Architecture:**
- Process sandboxing using Linux namespaces and cgroups
- Role-based permission matrix stored in secure config
- Command filtering pipeline with blacklist/whitelist enforcement
- Input sanitization and output scrubbing for sensitive data

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

**1. Discord Integration Layer**
```
├── discord/
│   ├── bot.go           # Main bot initialization and event handling
│   ├── handlers.go      # Message parsing and command routing
│   ├── formatter.go     # Discord message formatting and embedding
│   └── streaming.go     # Real-time message updates and truncation
```

**2. Command Execution Engine**
```
├── executor/

│   ├── output.go        # Output capture, streaming, and management
│   └── timeout.go       # Execution timeout and cancellation handling
```

**3. Permission System**
```
├── auth/
│   ├── roles.go         # Discord role to permission mapping
│   ├── validator.go     # Command permission validation
│   ├── sudo.go          # Temporary elevated access management
│   └── audit.go         # Security audit logging
```

**4. Output Management**
```
├── output/
│   ├── buffer.go        # Rolling buffer for real-time output
│   ├── pastebin.go      # External service integration
│   ├── truncator.go     # Intelligent output truncation
│   └── formatter.go     # Output formatting for Discord
```

**5. Configuration & Security**
```
├── config/
│   ├── config.go        # Configuration loading and validation
│   ├── security.go      # Command filtering and security policies
│   ├── aliases.go       # Command alias management
│   └── encryption.go    # Sensitive data encryption/decryption
