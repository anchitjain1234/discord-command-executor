# Task: Role-Based Permission System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive role-based permission system that controls which users can execute which commands on the Discord bot. The system should support hierarchical roles, command-specific permissions, and per-server configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define role hierarchy with multiple permission levels (admin, moderator, user, guest)
- [ ] Create permission matrix mapping roles to allowed commands
- [ ] Implement per-server role configuration storage
- [ ] Add command permission checking before execution
- [ ] Support dynamic role assignment and modification
- [ ] Include audit logging for permission changes
- [ ] Provide admin commands for role management
- [ ] Handle edge cases (missing roles, invalid permissions)

## Technical Details

### Core Components
1. **Role Definition System**
   - Hierarchical role structure with inheritance
   - Default roles: `admin`, `moderator`, `user`, `guest`
   - Custom role creation support
   - Role priority/precedence handling

2. **Permission Matrix**
   - Command-to-role mapping storage
   - Granular permission control (execute, view, configure)
   - Wildcard pattern support for command groups
   - Permission inheritance from parent roles

3. **Storage Layer**
   - JSON/SQLite database for role configurations
   - Per-server permission overrides
   - User-to-role assignments
   - Permission change history/audit trail

4. **Middleware Integration**
   - Pre-command permission validation
   - Error handling for insufficient permissions
   - Permission context passing to command handlers

### Implementation Strategy
- Create `PermissionManager` class with role validation methods
- Implement middleware function for Discord.js command handling
- Design database schema for roles, permissions, and assignments
- Add configuration commands for role management
- Create permission checking decorators/utilities

### Security Considerations
- Default deny policy (commands blocked unless explicitly allowed)
- Role escalation prevention
- Input validation for role assignments
- Protection against privilege abuse

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (Command Execution Engine) must be completed
- Discord.js permission system integration
- Database/storage solution selection

## Effort Estimate
**2-3 days** (16-24 hours)

### Breakdown:
- Role system design and implementation: 8-10 hours
- Permission matrix and storage: 6-8 hours
- Integration with command system: 4-6 hours
- Testing and edge case handling: 2-4 hours

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Unit tests covering role validation, permission checking, and edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests with mock Discord interactions
- [ ] Documentation for role configuration and usage
- [ ] Performance testing with large permission matrices
- [ ] Security review of permission bypass scenarios
- [ ] Admin interface for role management working
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback implemented
