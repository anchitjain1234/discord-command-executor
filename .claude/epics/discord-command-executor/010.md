# Task: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Description

Implement a comprehensive testing framework covering unit tests, integration tests, security tests, and performance benchmarks for the Discord command executor. This includes achieving >90% code coverage, automated test execution, and specialized test scenarios for security and performance validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Achieve >90% code coverage across all core packages
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic in executor, auth, output, and config packages
- [ ] Mock implementations for external dependencies (Discord API, pastebin services)
- [ ] Test fixtures and helpers for common test scenarios
- [ ] Parameterized tests for edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Discord API integration tests with real bot token (test environment)
- [ ] Pastebin service integration tests with multiple providers
- [ ] Database/file system integration tests for configuration and audit logs
- [ ] End-to-end command execution workflow tests
- [ ] Error scenario testing with external service failures

### Security Testing
- [ ] Command injection prevention tests
- [ ] Permission bypass attempt tests
- [ ] Input sanitization validation tests
- [ ] Process isolation security tests
- [ ] Privilege escalation prevention tests
- [ ] Audit trail integrity tests

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Concurrent command execution stress tests (10+ simultaneous commands)
- [ ] Memory usage profiling and leak detection
- [ ] Response time benchmarks (<500ms command initiation)
- [ ] Real-time streaming latency tests (<100ms output updates)
- [ ] Large output processing performance tests (>10MB outputs)

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration with automated test execution
- [ ] Test environment setup and teardown automation
- [ ] Code coverage reporting and enforcement
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning integration

```

### Mock Infrastructure
- Discord API mock server for reliable testing
- Pastebin service mocks with configurable responses
- File system mocks for configuration testing
- Process execution mocks for unit testing
- Network failure simulation for resilience testing

### Security Test Scenarios
- Command injection via Discord message content
- Path traversal attempts in command arguments
- Permission escalation through role manipulation
- Resource exhaustion attacks (CPU, memory, disk)
- Audit log tampering attempts

### Performance Benchmarks
- Command execution initiation: <500ms target
- Real-time output streaming: <100ms latency target
- Concurrent execution: 10+ commands without degradation
- Memory baseline: <50MB idle, bounded growth under load
- Large output processing: >10MB within 30 seconds

### CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Test result reporting and coverage visualization
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Automated test environment provisioning
