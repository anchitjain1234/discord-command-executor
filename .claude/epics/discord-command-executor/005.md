# Task: Command Security and Filtering

## Description
Implement a comprehensive command security system that validates, sanitizes, and filters commands before execution. This includes blacklist/whitelist mechanisms, dangerous command detection, and input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Command blacklist system with dangerous command patterns
- [ ] Optional whitelist mode for maximum security
- [ ] Input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Dangerous pattern detection (shell injection, file system access)
- [ ] Command length and complexity limits
- [ ] Real-time security scanning before execution
- [ ] Configurable security policies per server
- [ ] Security violation logging and alerting
- [ ] Bypass prevention and validation

## Technical Details

### Security Filters
1. **Command Blacklist**
   - Dangerous commands: `rm`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `fdisk`, `chmod +s`
   - Network access: `curl`, `wget`, `nc`, `ssh`, `telnet`
   - System modification: `mount`, `umount`, `service`, `systemctl`
   - Process control: `kill`, `killall`, `pkill`
   - File operations: `find / -exec`, `>`, `>>`, pipes to sensitive locations

2. **Whitelist Mode**
   - Explicitly allowed commands only
   - Safe utility commands: `ls`, `pwd`, `date`, `whoami`, `uname`
   - Limited file operations: `cat`, `head`, `tail` with restrictions
   - Safe information commands: `ps`, `df`, `free`, `top`

3. **Pattern Detection**
   - Shell injection attempts: `; && || |`
   - Path traversal: `../`, `~`, `/etc`, `/usr`, `/var`
   - Environment manipulation: `$()`, `backticks`, `${}`
   - Binary execution: executable file detection
   - Privilege escalation: `sudo`, `su`, `setuid`

### Input Validation
1. **Command Structure**
   - Maximum command length limits
   - Argument count restrictions
   - Character whitelist/blacklist
   - Unicode normalization
   - Control character filtering

2. **Content Analysis**
   - Regular expression pattern matching
   - Command parsing and AST analysis
   - Dangerous flag detection (`-r`, `--recursive`, `--force`)
   - Redirection operator blocking
   - Pipe chain analysis

### Security Policies
1. **Configurable Modes**
   - `strict`: Whitelist only
   - `moderate`: Blacklist with pattern detection
   - `permissive`: Basic validation only
   - `custom`: User-defined rules

2. **Per-Server Configuration**
   - Individual security levels
   - Custom blacklist/whitelist additions
   - Emergency lockdown mode
   - Trusted user bypasses (with audit)

### Implementation Architecture
```javascript
class SecurityFilter {
  validateCommand(command, context)
  checkBlacklist(command)
  checkWhitelist(command)
  detectDangerousPatterns(command)
  sanitizeInput(input)
  enforcePolicy(policy, command)
}
```

## Dependencies
- Task 003 (Command Execution Engine) for integration points
- Regular expression engine for pattern matching
- Configuration storage system

## Effort Estimate
**2 days** (14-16 hours)

### Breakdown:
- Blacklist/whitelist implementation: 4-5 hours
- Pattern detection and validation: 5-6 hours
- Security policy configuration system: 3-4 hours
- Testing and security validation: 2-3 hours
